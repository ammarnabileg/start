# HalaOps — CRM & Operational Intelligence System

> Blueprint for the next-generation CRM for **Hala Career**: not a sales CRM,
> but an Operational Intelligence System that combines tasks, performance,
> gamification, and AI insights — bilingual AR/EN by design.

## Documents
| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| [00-MASTER-BLUEPRINT.md](./00-MASTER-BLUEPRINT.md) | Vision, architecture, modules, roadmap (the main doc) |
| [01-database-schema.sql](./01-database-schema.sql) | Postgres 16 schema with RLS + pgvector |
| [02-api-spec.md](./02-api-spec.md) | REST + WebSocket + state machines |
| [03-gamification-and-kpi.md](./03-gamification-and-kpi.md) | XP formulas, anti-cheat, KPI engine, Truth Index |

## TL;DR
- **Modular Monolith** in NestJS + Next.js 15, event-driven core, RLS multi-tenant.
- **Five Pillars** for performance: Performance, Reliability, Leadership, Consistency, Growth.
- **Truth Index** prevents fake KPIs by requiring corroborating events.
- **Gamification** modeled on Duolingo (leagues, streaks, missions) but tied to real work, with anti-farming caps and after-hours dampers.
- **AI Copilot** embedded everywhere: smart assignment, voice-to-action, RAG chat, burnout detection, deal win prediction.
- **Bilingual-native**: RTL/LTR from day one, not a translation layer.
- **Roadmap**: MVP in 8 weeks → V2 (insights+AI) by week 20 → V3 (full game+mobile) by week 32 → Enterprise after.

## Why this is different
Most CRMs assume self-reported truth. HalaOps assumes nothing — every metric is derived from events the system observes, every score has an evidence trail, every leaderboard has anti-cheat guardrails. Management gets a live, honest view of the company.
